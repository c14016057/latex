	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each CPE consists of two execution pipelines.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item P0 : floating-pointer, vector operations. 
			\item P1 : Control transfer, load/store and register communication operations.
		\end{itemize}
		\item The two execution pipelines share an Instruction Decoder and an instruction queue.
		\item In each cycle, two instructions in the front of the queue are issued into two pipelines.
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Both instructions have no conflicts with the unifinished instructions issued before. 
		\item The two insturctions have no RAW or WAW conflicts.
		\item The two instructions can be handled by two execution pipelines separately.
